# Problem Statement: 	In your organization, there are many teams who are supposed to share 
# 			HDFS cluster for data storage. Often teams end up placing their 
#			data in wrong directories or other teamâ€™s directories. 
#			You are asked to come up with a process which administrator team 
#			can use to create dedicated data storage areas for respective teams.
